## What is this repo

The purpose of this repo is to be presented as a project for my class of computational modeling, unfortunately, as i was creating another model on netlogo for the entire semester, and only change to unity a week before the deadline, I did not have the time to finish it. This model is inspired by a game made by InnerSloth called Among Us. My model is concerned about the Artificial Intelligence and manipulation of attributes by the user. I have implemented the basic parts of it, that is the selection of crewmates and impostors.

## How to use
  As I have not yet finished, the only changeable attributes are the crewmate quantity on the Slider called Crewmate Quantity on Game scene. When started, the agents will receive an array of an array of tasks and move accordingly with the order. If an agent chooses to do the Cables tasks, he will finish all the three tasks of Cables and pick the next task in his array. The impostor will pick a crewmate to follow from the start, and when he is alone with him, the impostor will assassinate the crewmate, marking his tag as Dead. The behavior of reporting a body and making the impostor lose will be implemented someday

The prefab used to represent the crewmate can be found here [prefab](https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/character/other/among-us-red-man) (does not belong to us)
